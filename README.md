# Loomp.js

Loomp.js offers you a simple syntax to add to html to enable reactivity like big frameworks like Vue or React.

With no building process and no javascript needed, your code is naturally SEO friendly.


Available features:
- show/hide elements
- add/remove classes
- bind html parameters and content
- 2 way input data binding
- event listeners handlers (click, touch, keydown)
- loops


Loomp.js is a great fit for small interactions and adding interactivity to existing legacy projects.
